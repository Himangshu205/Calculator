# Calculator

This is a simple web-based calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project was created while learning JavaScript basics, 
focusing mainly on DOM manipulation and event handling using `onclick`.

Although it is a beginner-level project, it helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements 
and how basic logic is implemented in real-world UI components.
